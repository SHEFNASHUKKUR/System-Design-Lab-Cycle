PROGRAM CODE :


Setting the git configurations in terminal.

Use the below commands to set git configurations.

             git config --global user.name SHEFNASHUKKUR

We can use following command to see both tracked and untracked files.

             git status 

To commit the added file to local repository, Use the command :

             git commit -m "a meaningful comment".

To clone the entire github repository , use the command :

            git clone https://github.com/SHEFNASHUKKUR/System-Design-Lab-Cyclee.git

To push the committed file to our git repository , use the below command.

           git pull push https://github.com/SHEFNASHUKKUR/System-Design-Lab-Cyclee.git

           git push master https://github.com/SHEFNASHUKKUR/System-Design-Lab-Cyclee.git master
              
To creating a new branch and branch operations. Use the following commands :-
    
           git checkout -b repos  /*to create a branch named repos*/
              
           git branch             /*to show all branches*/

          git pull push https://github.com/SHEFNASHUKKUR/System-Design-Lab-Cyclee.git
           
          git push https://github.com/SHEFNASHUKKUR/System-Design-Lab-Cyclee.git repos                        
To merge the branch to our master branch,use following commands.

               git checkout master /*switching to master branch*/
               
               git merge repos    /*merging the branch repos*/

To cherry pick a commit done in repos branch to master branch, use the command :

               git cherry-pick commitid

To view the operations in a graph format , use the command:

               git log –-graph

To rebase the branch to master branch , use the command :
 
               git checkout repos

               git rebase master /* rebasing branch to master branch*/

To view the history of git commits, use the command :

               git log --oneline

To delete a feature branch , use the command :

               git branch -d repos /*deletes repos branch*/
